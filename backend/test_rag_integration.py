    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms 
    and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task 
    through experience, without being explicitly programmed.
    
    The key characteristic of machine learning is that it learns from data. Instead of following 
    pre-programmed instructions, machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on 
    training data to make predictions or decisions.
    
    There are three main types of machine learning:
    1. Supervised learning - uses labeled training data
    2. Unsupervised learning - finds patterns in unlabeled data  
    3. Reinforcement learning - learns through interaction with environment
