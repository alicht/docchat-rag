Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Popular techniques include:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Association Rules

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem.

Applications of Machine Learning:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis
- Financial Trading
