This is a test document for RAG functionality.

It contains multiple paragraphs with different topics.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. It combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks with billions of parameters that can generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform various language tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering.

This document will be used to test the document upload and embedding functionality of our RAG system.
